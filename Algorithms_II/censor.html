	<h3>Create a function that takes two parameters. The first a word to censor and the second a string of text that may contain the word to be censored. Return the string with the censored word replaced with the correct length of *'s.</h3>
	<h3>Hard mode: have it replaced with random symbols instead of just *'s.</h3>

	<h4>We'll search for 'the' in the following string: "I was chased by the dog while running today.</h4>
